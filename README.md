### Suman server - Web UI for test results

When this server is live, it will collect test results to a local SQLite3 database, and display results via
a React single-page web application.

Because Suman runs tests asynchronously (concurrently) - only using Suman server can you see the chronological and
fully ordered/organized test output.

Furthermore, Suman server allows you to easily share and discuss results with your team.
